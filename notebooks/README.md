# Jupyter Notebooks, Exploratory Analysis and Prototyping

Jupyter colabs and python scripts in this directory are used to create a processing pipeline that help us generate data and load it into our project database. The cloud database chosen has data related to:

1. User-to-Song rating/playback information
2. Song-to-Song similarity information based on musicality.

These two sets of data will be used to train machine learning models within the MLOps phase of our project.
